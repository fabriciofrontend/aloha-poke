I'm very excited to share my first personal project.😁🙌

Before I begin, I'd like to say that when I started my career at CESAE last June, I didn't know anything about the world of programming. So, I've been dedicating myself 100% and learning more and more. 

About the project, after finishing the modules of HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT, and JQUERY, I decided to apply these concepts simply to put the content learned. In addition to making it responsive to any device, that is another important factor.

It's a fictional page from a Hawaiian restaurant.🥗 The goal is to pass the main information to your customers.

About the technologies, I used them in a simple way so that anyone could understand the code. 👨🏻‍💻

It was very pleasurable, and I am so happy with my first result. 🚀🚀

I hope you enjoy it.🫡✌️
